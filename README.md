 Representation Learning for the Automatic Indexing of Sound Effects Libraries (ISMIR 2022): Deep audio embeddings pre-trained on UCS & Non-UCS-compliant datasets.
 
This work was inspired by the creation of the [Universal Category System (UCS)](https://universalcategorysystem.com), an industry-proposed public domain initiative initialized by [Tim Nielsen](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0631004), [Justin Drury](https://twitter.com/jaydee2190), [Kai Paquin](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5226068), and others. First launching in the fall of 2020, UCS offers a standardized framework for sound effects library metadata designed by and for sound designers and editors.
